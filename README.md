## Hello! My name is Martin Pare
To be brief, I am an upcoming graduating Senior at University of Maryland studying Information Systems at the Smith School. 
I am currently pivoting towards Software Engineering, specifically in Web Development (focused more on Full-Stack or Back-end).
The reason why I am pivoting is because I found after taking one programming class, I realized that coding was really fun. I enjoyed
solving problems that required you to critically think and the excitement of running that script or program and seeing your solution
pop up is one of the greatest feelings in the world.

## What is this capstone about?
This capstone served as my finished progress of the Udemy Course I was taking. It incorporated everything I needed to know from the course and these skills were:
* Abstraction: Creating interfaces and implementing them, Abstracting parent classes and abstracted methods
  * ![image](https://github.com/martinpare1208/OOP-Capstone/assets/144491182/5b14f365-b740-49f7-89bd-5bf5719d454e)

* Polymorphism: Having child classes become their parents and using the "super" keyword
  * ![image](https://github.com/martinpare1208/OOP-Capstone/assets/144491182/f00477eb-8086-4058-9469-3f9468ad7133)

* Inheritence: Creating super and child classes and having the super class extend to child classes
  * Check image above
* Encapsulation: Using private fields with getters and setters, and provide deep copies to protect the object's data from being overwritten.

* Three Layer Design:
  * Presentation Layer: Present data to user
  * Service Layer: Facilitate the presentation Layer and Repository Layer and handle all the business logic
    * ![image](https://github.com/martinpare1208/OOP-Capstone/assets/144491182/1fe515a2-058e-4c94-9c41-9fa56d0b0c51)
  * Repository Layer: Datastore to store data in a form of a hashmap in this example and holds CRUD functionality.

* Streamline operations and lambda functions (Declarative Programming)
  * ![image](https://github.com/martinpare1208/OOP-Capstone/assets/144491182/c1e76398-e939-4568-8c89-4664d82d004a)
 

## Key Takeaways
This course was very helpful in attaining a key concept in Computer Science, Object-Oriented Programming.
What I learned from OOP was:
* Maintainable and reusable code
* Clean and readable code
* Efficiency in writing code
* Good practice coding habits

I chose Java as my primary language to learn OOP because Java made me always think about what I am coding.
Yes, it is extremely verbose, but for good reason. I believe because it is verbose, it makes the code readable once you learn the basics of Java.
For example, I know that this function HAS to return a double when the syntax is "public double getDouble()".
The explicit program helped me solidify my rocky foundation and I feel much more confident and knowledgeable in OOP and Java Concepts.

## My next steps
I am now going to take a course in Udemy that focuses on Spring Boot. Then I will create personal projects based on what I learned and implement the good coding practices I have shown here.
In tandem of learning Spring Boot, I will be also be doing Data Structures & Algorithms. This will help me pass coding interviews and make myself more marketable when applying for jobs.
